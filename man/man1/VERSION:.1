.SH DESCRIPTION



.IP 1. 4
\fBflower\fP(1) is primarily intended to allow for a preference of lowercase
characters when working with older uppercase-only FORTRAN this program
will convert the code to lowercase once the code has been converted
to free-format Fortran source file format.
.RS
.PP
It can also convert the code to uppercase. In each case comments and
quoted text are left as-is.
.PP
This is a basic program that writes its results to stdout and does
not recognize Hollerith strings and preprocessor directives as
special cases.
.PP
Tabs should be expanded before processing the file.
.PP
\fBflower\fP(1) depends on the input being plain standard free-format
Fortran so the output should be carefully checked.
.RE
.IP 2. 4
It may also be used to generate simple statistics about what percentage
of the code is comments.
.IP 3. 4
\fBflower\fP(1) can also be used to strip the comments from the code.
.IP 4. 4
Lastly, the code can be removed so the comments can be used for documentation
or run through utilities like spell checkers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B FILENAME
Fortran source file which is to be converted to lowercase
.TP
.B \fB--nocomment\fP
remove comment characters
.TP
.B \fB--nocode\fP
remove code characters
.TP
.B \fB--toupper\fP
convert code characters to uppercase instead of lowercase
.TP
.B \fB--verbose\fP
turn on verbose mode including file statistics. Note
that if \fB--nocomment\fP and \fB--nocode\fP are selected \fB--verbose\fP
is implied.
.TP
.B \fB--stat\fP
is the same as \fB--nocomment\fP \fB--nocode\fP \fB--verbose\fP, meaning
no other output than file statistics will be produced.
If present, \fB--nocomment\fP, \fB--nocode\fP, and \fB--verbose\fP are
ignored.
.TP
.B \fB--help\fP
display help text and exit
.TP
.B \fB--version\fP
display version text and exit
.SH EXAMPLES
Typical usage
.PP
.nf

     flower sample.f90 > sample_new.f90

     # show stats for files measuring percent of comments
     flower --stat *.f90 *.F90

     # check spelling on comments
     flower --nocode *.f90 *.F90|spell

     # grep code ignoring comments
     flower --nocomment *.f90 *.F90|grep -iw contains
